    Calculate the i-th Lagrange polynomial at point X.
    
    Parameters:
    - i: Index of the Lagrange polynomial to calculate.
    - xi: Set of interpolation points.
    - X: Point at which to evaluate the polynomial.
    
    Returns:
    The value of the i-th Lagrange polynomial at X.
    
    Note:
    Ï„col(j) in baloo paper is not compatible with fft from lagrange basis to monomial.
    we really have to calculate the lagrange basis and combine them into polynomial and commit
